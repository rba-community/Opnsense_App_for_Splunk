# OPNsense App (Opnsense_App_for_Splunk)

!!! quote ""
    __*Disclaimer*__

    This Splunk App is community driven and not affiliated with the official [OPNsense® Firewall](https://opnsense.org/). As such, the included documentation does not contain information on how to get started with this firewall. Rather, this documentation serves as a guide to help visualize the data in Splunk. Please visit [https://opnsense.org/](https://opnsense.org/) for documentation on installing/configuring your own OPNsense firewall.

The OPNsense App for Splunk helps make your firewall data meaningful. Visualize system or security related events recorded by the [OPNsense® Firewall](https://opnsense.org/). This app requires the [OPNsense Add-on for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4538/).

## Key Features

* See system information including packages, plugins, and available updates.
* Better manage your Splunk license with a view to help identify the impact of the OPNsense data volume.
* Analyze traffic patterns and help troubleshoot issues.
* Visualize VPN traffic and look for suspicious connections.

## Assumptions

1. You have a working OPNsense firewall.
2. You have a working Splunk environment.
3. Basic understanding of Splunk and OPNsense.
4. The [OPNsense Add-on for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4538/) has been installed and configured.
